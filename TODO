TODO list for libcaptury
========================

	* api documentation
	* add XShm/XImage video source support for capturing from native X11 screens that are not OpenGL composited e.g.
	  (XShm might come quite in handy for non-compositing window managers using libcaptury's 
	  incremental capturing feature)
	* add audio capturing (ALSA source device)
	* more examples?
